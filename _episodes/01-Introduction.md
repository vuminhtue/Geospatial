Here we use the tutorial from "**Use Data for Earth and Environmental Science in Open Source Python**", a lecture from Earth Lab at CU Boulder.

To better fit the content within 2 hours- workshop, we assume participants are familiar with GIS data like vector shapefile and raster data and basic Python command

The workshop is run using M2 via HPC OpenOnDemand with the conda environment setup. Please refer to the setup task to create the conda environment and Jupyter Kernels before the workshop.

Following Python library are needed:
- xarray
- rioxarray
- earthpy
- matplotlib


Following data is used: Colorado river data.

Let's get started.
